My name is Wasutep Luangtip, or Ton for short. I am an astrophysicist working on observations of accretion onto compact objects.

My research focuses on the observational properties of accretion in extreme environments, including ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) as well as X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei (AGN). I specialise in high-energy astrophysics, with particular emphasis on systems accreting at high and super-Eddington mass accretion rates.

My work involves detailed spectral and timing analyses of data from major X-ray observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift, NuSTAR, and Chandra, aiming to better understand the physical processes governing accretion and energy release around compact objects.
